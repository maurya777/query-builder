## query-builder

- ~~create wrapper component for react awesome query builder~~
- ~~create test harness to demo~~
- ~~host on netlify~~ (https://query-builder-2021.netlify.app/)
- ~~make trivial styling change~~
- ~~create diagram for comparing Tree Query (lib) vs Node Leaf Query~~
- ~~tests w/ Jest for library functions~~
- ~~demo various outputs~~
- ~~library: function to convert Tree Query into Node Leaf Query~~
- ~~library: function to convert Node Leaf Query into Tree Query~~
- _nice to have_: library: Node Leaf Query into Tree Query: use recursion to remove 5 nesting limit
- include custom component
- allow other field types (String is text; DeviceTag and SoftwareTag are both multiselect; Number is number)
- remove excess operators from library
- processFields to have full list of operators (NB should always be mathmatical operators or 'like')
- check our multiselect matches ["Color2" functionality](https://ukrbublik.github.io/react-awesome-query-builder/)
